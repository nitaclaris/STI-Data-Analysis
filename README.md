# STI Project Dataset Analysis
This project is about data manipulation and cleaning.
Key activities included comprehensive data cleaning, verification, and preliminary statistical analysis. Missing values were systematically identified and addressed using source documents for data verification. Variables with multiple categories were cleaned and appropriately collapsed to improve analytical interpretability and statistical validity.

Following data preparation, STI prevalence was calculated, and a bivariate analysis was conducted to assess associations between sociodemographic characteristics and STI status. Chi-square tests were applied where assumptions were met, and Fisher’s exact tests were used for sparse categories. All bivariate results were exported to Excel for reporting and further use.

Skills demonstrated:
Data cleaning & validation • Missing data handling • Variable recoding & categorization • Prevalence estimation • Bivariate analysis (Chi-square & Fisher’s exact tests) • Stata automation • Results exportation
